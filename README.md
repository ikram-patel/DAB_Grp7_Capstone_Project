<h1>Multi Mart: Loyalty Card Expansion</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our data analysis and visualization project centered around Multi Mart Retail Store. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and 
visually intuitive understanding of the store's sales performance and revenue generation from the years 2019 to 2023.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The primary objective of the visualization project for Multi Mart Retail store is to provide a comprehensive and visually intuitive view of the sales that happened in the store 
and revenue generated from sales from the year 2019 to 2023. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the store's sales performance and revenue generation. With a 
focus on customer behavior and preferences, our goal is to guide the store in making informed decisions about the potential expansion of its Loyalty Card program to new regions.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<b>Excel:</b> Utilized for data preprocessing tasks and intermediate analysis.<br>
<b>Python:</b> Employed for data processing, analysis, and statistical computations to extract actionable insights from the raw data.<br>
<b>Tableau:</b> Utilized for creating interactive and insightful visualizations that effectively convey sales trends and revenue generation patterns over the specified period.

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
The data set consists of 15 variables and 10000 records tracking sales at each customer level, along with the number of visits made by the customers to the store and it also 
stores the Loyalty card information about which customers are currently holding Loyalty Card.

<h2>Data Processing</h2> 
The raw data from Multi Mart Retail Store was processed using Python, ensuring its cleanliness and compatibility for analysis.

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
We started by loading the given dataset into a pandasâ€™ data frame for EDA, after which we obtained a comprehensive report outlining the data types of every column in the 
dataset. This made it clearer to us how many of the columns were numerical and how many were categorical. To comprehend the dataset's fundamental statistical summary, 
we next computed the statistics. Additionally, we determined whether any missing values exist in the dataset.

<h2>Visualization</h2> 
Utilized Tableau, we generated a series of visualizations that offer a comprehensive view of sales trends, revenue generation, customer behavior and Loyal Card Expansion Analysis.
Thereafter creating two dashboards first one focussing on revenue generated by the store, second one focusing on Loyalty card performance helping business to decide whether 
Membership card can be expanded to other regions.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
It was observed through the analysis that infrequent high-revenue customers are crucial, contributing up to $5.96 million. Influencer endorsements, online ads, and 
social media are major revenue drivers. Debit/credit cards are preferred for payment. Shorter revenue duration customers make more purchases. Peak revenue occurs mid-year, 
with a decline in the last quarter. Feedback disparity exists, with non-loyalty cardholders providing higher scores.
